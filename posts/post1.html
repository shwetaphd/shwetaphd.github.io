    <h2>Bhagawad Geeta Chapter 1 (Arjun Vishad Yog)</h2>
  </section>
  <p style="color: gray; font-size: 0.75em;">October 28, 2025</p>

      <p>
        The first chapter of the Bhagawad Geeta is called the “Arjun Vishad Yog,” which means “The Yog of Sorrow and Confusion.”
        In this blog, I share my symbolic understanding after reading this chapter.
        <div style="height: 20px;"></div>

        
        Symbolically speaking, the battlefield of Kurukshetra represents the battlefield of life, where each of us faces moral conflicts between our duties and emotions.
        Arjun’s sorrow (Vishad) is a universal symbol of human suffering. We are all Arjun, constantly shifting between the three Guns (Satvik, Rajsik, 
        and Tamsik) depending on the situations we face at different times.
        
        Within us, we all carry Krishna (Satvik Gun), Karan (Rajsik Gun), and Duryodhan (Tamsik Gun). As life moves forward, we keep choosing, consciously or 
        unconsciously, which of these qualities to embody.
        
        <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
        
        Though we often see suffering as something negative, it is actually the starting point of a spiritual journey, pushing us to question, reflect, and seek guidance
        just as Arjun turned to Krishna. The state of sorrow and suffering acts as a catalyst for spiritual growth, leading to union (Yog) with divine wisdom (Krishna). 
        When we start recognizing the deeper purpose of our struggles, we can live with more acceptance and less stress, 
        ultimately moving toward inner peace and clarity beyond suffering.

        Arjun’s moment of weakness before the war represents how we often get stuck in fear, self-doubt, and confusion when faced with difficult decisions. 
        Within us, there’s always an inner voice debating what’s right and wrong.
        Since childhood, we have been taught to label everything as right or wrong. But do we really know what is called 'right' and 'wrong'? In fact, the definition of right and wrong changes with situation and time.
        The Achyut (which can not be destroyed; Krishna) within us helps bring clarity when we are lost.
        Do you imagine Krishna as just a divine figure in human form? If you notice, Krishna is always portrayed as someone who never gives straightforward answers. 
        He guides through reflection.
        A part of Krishna lives within us (atma), a silent presence that doesn’t speak but guides us from within. So when we talk to our inner self, it may not reply, 
        yet it shows us the way, just like Krishna.        
        In times of sorrow, like Arjun, we must turn inward, question ourselves, and connect with that inner Krishna. This process of introspection can lead us toward a state of Sanyas Yog (
        detachment from illusion and emotional turmoil). 
        Inside us, there is always a battle between wisdom (Krishna) and ignorance (Duryodhan). The journey of overcoming Duryodhan through Krishna leads to enlightenment and peace.
        
        <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
        
        Before engaging in any “war” (struggles during life), we must first analyze our situation deeply, just as Duryodhan and Arjun studied their armies and their opponents.
        The difference between living as Arjun or Duryodhan is very subtle.
        After observing the battlefield, Duryodhan became proud and overconfident, believing that he would win. Arjun, on the other hand, went into deep introspection and surrendered to Krishna.
        Struggles are inevitable, but how we face them depends on our Gunas.
        Each of us has different strengths: health, knowledge, talent, skill, destiny, and wisdom. In the Mahabharata, these qualities are beautifully symbolized through characters 
        like Bhishma, Dronacharya, Ashwatthama, Karna, Draupadi, and Krishna, respectively. While we should focus on nurturing what’s in our control, like knowledge and skill, the final outcome in life 
        depends on the harmony of all these elements. Remember, Arjuna, who had both destiny (Draupadi) and wisdom (Krishna) by his side, won the battle (struggles).
        We should introspect timely and suppress the Duryodhana that sometimes rises inside us.

        <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
      
        Also, notice that feminine energy is often associated with peace and luck. Throughout the Mahabharat, women were humiliated and forced to sacrifice their dignity and choices, 
        which eventually resulted in the heinous war.        
        The feminine energy, whether in a man or a woman, should never be disrespected. When we disrespect it, it leads to destruction.
