    <h2>Bhagawad Geeta Chapter 1 (Arjun Vishad Yog)</h2>
  </section>
  <p style="color: gray; font-size: 0.75em;">October 28, 2025</p>

      <p>
        The first chapter of the Bhagawad Geeta is called the “Arjun Vishad Yog,” which means “The Yog of Sorrow and Confusion.”
       In this blog, I share my symbolic understanding and reflections after reading this chapter.
       <br>
        Symbolically speaking, the battlefield of Kurukshetra represents the battlefield of life, where each of us faces moral conflicts between our duties and emotions.
        Arjun’s sorrow (Vishad) is a universal symbol of human suffering. We are all Arjun at different times, constantly shifting between the three Guns (Satvik, Rajsik, 
        and Tamsik) depending on the situations we face.
        
        Within us, we all carry Krishna (the Satvik Gun), Karan (the Rajsik Gun), and Duryodhan (the Tamsik Gun). As life moves forward, we keep choosing, consciously or 
        unconsciously, which of these qualities to embody.
        
        <br>
        
        Our states of sorrow and suffering act as a catalyst for spiritual growth, leading to union (Yog) with divine wisdom (Krishna). Though we often see suffering 
        as something negative, it is actually the starting point of a spiritual journey, acting as an "eye-opener" pushing us to question, reflect, and seek guidance
        just as Arjun turning to Krishna. When we start recognizing the deeper purpose of our struggles, we can live with more acceptance and less stress, 
        ultimately moving toward inner peace and clarity beyond suffering.
        
        <br>

        
        Arjun’s moment of weakness before the war represents how we often get stuck in fear, self-doubt, and confusion when faced with difficult decisions. 
        Within us, there’s always an inner voice debating what’s right and wrong.
        Since childhood, we have been taught to label everything as right or wrong. But do we really know what is called right or wrong? 
        The Achyut (which can not be destroyed; Krishna/Atma) within us helps bring clarity when we are lost.
        Do you believe Krishna was just a divine figure in human form? If you notice, Krishna is always portrayed as someone who never gives direct answers. 
        He guides through reflection.
        I personally feel that Krishna lives within us, as our higher consciousness or atma, a silent presence that doesn’t speak but guides us from within.
        
        In times of sorrow, like Arjun, we must turn inward, question ourselves, and connect with that inner Krishna. This process of introspection can lead us toward a state of Sanyas Yog,
        detachment from illusion and emotional turmoil.
        
        Inside us, there is always a battle between wisdom (Krishna) and ignorance (Duryodhan). The journey of overcoming ignorance through wisdom leads to enlightenment and peace.
        
        <br>
        
        Before engaging in any “war” (symbolic struggles of daily life), we must first analyze our situation deeply, just as Duryodhan and Arjun studied their armies and their opponents.
        The difference between living as Arjun or Duryodhan is very subtle.
        After observing the battlefield, Duryodhan became proud and overconfident, believing he would win. Arjun, on the other hand, went into deep reflection and surrendered to Krishna.
        Struggles are inevitable, but how we face them depends on our Gunas.
        Each of us possesses various inner elements (Guns): health (Bhishma), knowledge (Dronacharya), talent (Ashwatthama), skill (Karan), fate (Draupadi), and wisdom (Krishna).
        We should focus on nurturing Guns, which are in our control, and prepare ourselves for life’s challenges.
        
        Notice how, in the Mahabharata, feminine energy is often associated with peace and balance. When this energy is respected, it brings harmony; when disrespected, it 
        leads to destruction. Throughout the epic, women were humiliated and forced to sacrifice their dignity and choices, which eventually contributed to the heinous war.
        
        Being in a female body, women should be especially mindful and caring toward themselves.
        What I mean is that the feminine energy, whether in a man or a woman, should never be disrespected. When others disrespect it, it leads to imbalance and pain; when we, as women, 
        fail to honor our own bodies and inner power, we weaken that divine energy within us.
        Since I am in a female body, I feel that this energy is incredibly powerful, and with that power comes the responsibility to be extra cautious, nurturing, and respectful 
        toward ourselves. When the feminine energy is protected and valued, it brings peace and harmony; when it is ignored or misused, it leads to inner and outer conflict.
