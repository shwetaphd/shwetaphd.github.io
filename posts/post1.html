    <h2>Bhagawad Geeta Chapter 1 (Arjun Vishad Yog)</h2>
  </section>

      <p>
This chapter is about the 'Yog of Knowledge'. <br>
The battlefield of Kurukshetra represents the battlefield of life, which is full of moral conflicts and struggles between our duties and emotions.
Arjun’s inner weakness before the war shows how we too often feel fear, self-doubt, and confusion when faced with tough choices. Inside us, there is always a voice asking what is right and what is wrong.
Since childhood, we are taught to label people, actions, or events right or wrong. But do we really know what is right or wrong? Do we live with that much awareness?
Achyut, the divine guide, symbolizes the higher wisdom within us that helps us see clearly when we are lost.
It is often during such moments of confusion and doubt that lead to enlightenment.
